# Phonebook Management System in C

A simple yet functional command-line application for managing contacts, built entirely in C. This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts such as `structs`, `arrays`, `functions`, and `string manipulation`.

## Features
* **Add Contact**: Save a new contact with a name and phone number.
* **View All Contacts**: Display a formatted list of all saved contacts.
* **Search Contact**: Find a contact by searching for their name.
* **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact from the phonebook.
* **Cross-Platform**: Clears the console screen on both Windows (`cls`) and Unix-like systems (`clear`).
